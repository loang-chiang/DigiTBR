# Flask-template

Flask template for future projects complete with
* CSS and JS files (empty)
* Templates: index, layout, login, register
* App.py file that configures a flask_sqlalchemy sqlite database and deals with register/login/logout
* A .gitignore file with all the cache directories in it

Have fun!
